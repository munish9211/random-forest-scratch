# random-forest-scratch
Course Project done for MTH552A : STATISTICAL &amp; AI TECHNIQUES IN DATA MINING under Dr. Amit Mitra during 2021-22 II.

Description :

• Implemented Decision Tree and Random Forest algorithms for classifications using native python and NumPy library.

• Used various dissimilarity measures for splitting such as Gini‑Index, Entropy and Misclassification Error Rate(MER).

• Tested on various real data‑sets(Wisconsin, Iris, E.Coli) & achieved accuracy comparable to sklearn’s implementation
